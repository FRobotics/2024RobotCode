VI		Notes

X ArmBegin2	X  Suggest naming this Arm2Begin 
		X  The NEO is a "brushless" motor.
		X  Use "set limit switch config" for "forward" switch.  
		   	X Set to enabled to TRUE.
		   	X Set polarity to normally open.
		X  Use "set limit switch config" for "reverse" switch.  
		   	X Set to enabled to TRUE.
		   	X Set polarity to normally open.
		X  Use "Set Ramp Rate".  Suggest 0 to full speed in 0.2 seconds.
		X  Use "Set sensor conversion".  For postion if 1 = Revloutions, 
			use Deg/Revolutions and 1/GearRatio to calculate new
			conversion factor.   Same thing for velocity.  Standard units 
			are Revolution / Minute.  We know 1 Minute / 60 seconds 
			and Deg/Revolutions and 1/GearRatio.
		X set a value for initial position.  Put a note that this needs to be
			set.

X sArmExecute2	X Suggest renaming this to Arm2Execute...
		X This will be position control.  The math library now has a position
			control routine.
		X Read the sensors first ( position, velocity, forward and reverse limit switches )
		X write these to network tables.
		X use position control to set motor output.  We can discuss tuning.
